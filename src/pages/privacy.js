          LifeLoop is based, and this web site is hosted, in the United States

          Site, visiting the Site, or otherwise using the Site, please note that
          any personally identifiable information that you provide to LifeLoop
          may be transferred to or utilized by LifeLoop or its affiliates in the
          United States. Any such personally identifiable information provided
          may be processed and stored in the United States by LifeLoop or a
          service provider acting on its behalf.

          <strong>The Information LifeLoop Collects</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Users may provide and LifeLoop may collect personally identifiable
          information from Users in a variety of ways. Personally identifiable
          information may include, without limitation: (i)&nbsp;contact data
          (such as a User’s name, mailing and e-mail addresses);
          (ii)&nbsp;demographic data (such as a User’s zip code or age); or
          (iii) other information requested during the account registration
          process. If you communicate with LifeLoop by e-mail or otherwise, post
          User Content to the Site, post messages to any forums, complete online
          forms, surveys or entries, provide information outside of the account
          registration process, or otherwise interact with or uses the features
          on the Site, any information you provide may be collected by LifeLoop.
        </p>
        <p>
          LifeLoop may also collect information about how Users use the Site,
          for example, by tracking the number of unique views received by the
          pages of the Site, or the domains and Internet Protocol (“IP”)
          addresses from which Users originate. While not all of the information
          that LifeLoop collects from Users is personally identifiable, it may
          be associated with personally identifiable information that Users
          provide LifeLoop through the Site or otherwise. Additionally, certain
          information regarding your computer systems, network locations, IP
          address, and software may be communicated to LifeLoop in certain
          circumstances by the digital rights management systems associated with
          certain Content that you download or access via the Site in order to
          prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the associated Content.
          Non-personally identifiable information collected by LifeLoop (such as
          patterns of utilization) is exclusively owned by LifeLoop and may be
          used as it sees fit in accordance with applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          <underline>Cookies</underline>
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most web sites, the Site uses cookies and web log files to track
          site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer
          that allows LifeLoop to recognize you as a User when you return to the
          Site using the same computer and web browser. Like the information you
          enter during account registration, cookies and log file data are used
          to customize your experience on the Site. One type of cookie, known as
          a “persistent” cookie, is set once you have logged in to your Site
          account. The next time you visit our Site, the persistent cookie will
          allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to
          log in before using the Site. In order to access or change any of your
          private information, you must log in with your password even if your
          computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if you log out
          of the Site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you
          visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie,
          called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to
          the Site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close
          your web browser. You can choose to disable cookies on your browser or
          allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, however
          this may prevent you from utilizing certain features of the Site.

        <p>
          <underline>IP Addresses</underline>
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the communications standards on the Internet, we automatically
          receive the uniform resource locator (“URL”) of the web site from
          which you came and the web site to which you proceed once you leave
          the Site. We also receive the IP address of your computer (or the
          proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer
          operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the
          name of your Internet service provider (“ISP”). This information is
          used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Site. The
          linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable
          information is shared with third parties in accordance with this
          Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <underline>Web Beacons and Ad Networks</underline>
        </p>
        <p>
          We may allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve
          advertisements to Users via the Site. Ad networks include third party
          ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.
          LifeLoop may “target” some ads to Users that fit a certain general
          profile. To deliver these ads properly, the Site may include a file,
          called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the
          Site or implement other monitoring technologies so the networks may
          provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for
          advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other web
          sites. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to
          display targeted ads on other web sites as a substitute for random,
          irrelevant ads. In addition, the Site may use the technology of ad
          networks to serve ads only when you visit this Site. Ad networks may
          use non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order
          to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of
          particular interest to you while you visit this Site. Because your web
          browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad
          network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own
          cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

          <strong>How LifeLoop Uses Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          LifeLoop may use personally identifiable information collected through
          the Site for the specific purposes for which the information was
          collected, to contact Users regarding Content, advertise products or
          services offered by LifeLoop, or otherwise to enhance Users’
          experience with LifeLoop and/or the Site. LifeLoop may also use
          information collected through the Site for research regarding the
          effectiveness of the Site and the business planning, marketing,
          advertising, and sales efforts of LifeLoop, its trusted affiliates,
          independent contractors, and business partners. Information collected
          from you may also be used to ensure compliance with certain terms,
          conditions, and agreements entered between you and LifeLoop as well as
          to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of Content downloaded or
          otherwise accessed via the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          LifeLoop will communicate with you through email and notices posted on
          this Site. These may include a series of welcome emails which help
          inform new Users about various features of the Site, emails,
          confirmations regarding actions taken by you on the Site, and notices
          relating to the proper functioning of the Site or your account.
          LifeLoop may use your personal information to send you promotional
          information relating to the Content, products, and services offered by
          third parties that LifeLoop feels may be of interest to you. The
          personal information you provide will allow us to alert you to new
          developments, new products, features, enhancements, special offers,
          upgrade opportunities, surveys, contests, and events of interest. We
          strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers
          that we think you would appreciate receiving. To opt out of further
          communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your
          information has been shared, please contact that partner directly. We
          may send LifeLoop emails that may contain information regarding third
          party products or services; however, this doesn’t mean that we’ve
          traded your personal information to any party.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disclosure of Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          LifeLoop may disclose personally identifiable information collected
          from Users to its parent, subsidiary, and other related companies,
          trusted affiliates, independent contractors, and business partners who
          will use the information for the purposes outlined above, as necessary
          to provide the services offered by the Site and the Site itself, and
          for the specific purposes for which the information was collected.
          LifeLoop may disclose personally identifiable information at the
          request of law enforcement or governmental agencies or in response to
          subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, to establish, protect
          or exercise LifeLoop’s legal or other rights, to defend against a
          legal claim or as otherwise allowed by law. LifeLoop may disclose
          personally identifiable information in order to protect the rights,
          property, or safety of a User or any other person. LifeLoop may
          disclose personally identifiable information to investigate or prevent
          a violation by User of any contractual or other relationship with
          LifeLoop or where LifeLoop has a good faith belief that access,
          preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably
          necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of LifeLoop, its
          users or the public or the perpetration of any illegal or harmful
          activity. LifeLoop may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based
          on information collected from Users to Content developers, investors,
          advertisers, and potential partners. Finally, LifeLoop may disclose or
          transfer personally identifiable information collected from Users in
          connection with or in contemplation of a sale of its assets or
          business or a merger, consolidation, or other reorganization of its
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Personal Information Provided as Part of User Content</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If a User includes such User’s personally identifiable information as
          part of the User Content that such User posts to the Site, such
          information may be made available to any parties using the Site and/or
          such User Content. LifeLoop does not edit or otherwise remove such
          information from User Content before it is posted on the Site. If a
          User does not wish to have such User’s personally identifiable
          information made available in this manner, such User must remove any
          such information from the User Content before posting. User contact
          information (which may include, without limitation, a User’s username
          and email address) may be included with any User Content that a User
          posts via the Site. LifeLoop is not liable for any damages caused or
          incurred due to personally identifiable information made available in
          the foregoing manners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Security of Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about Users that is maintained on LifeLoop’s systems is
          protected using industry standard security measures. In order to
          secure your personal information, access to your data is
          password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by [SSL
          encryption] when it is exchanged between your web browser and the
          Site. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and
          LifeLoop cannot guarantee that the information submitted to,
          maintained on, or transmitted from its systems will be completely
          secure. LifeLoop is not responsible for the circumvention of any
          privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site by any
          Users or third parties.

          <strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits Users that are residents
          of California to request certain information regarding LifeLoop’s
          disclosures of personally identifiable information to third parties
          for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a

            Correcting, Updating, Accessing or Removing Personal Information
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent applicable, if a User’s personally identifiable
          information changes (such as a User’s zip code), or if a User no
          longer desires to receive non-account specific information from
          LifeLoop, LifeLoop will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update
          and/or remove that User’s previously-provided personal data. This can
          be done by contacting us at{' '}
          <Link to="/support">Lifeloop Support</Link>. Additionally, you may
          request access to the personally identifiable information as collected
          by LifeLoop by sending a request to LifeLoop as set forth above.
          Please note that in certain circumstances, LifeLoop may not be able to
          completely remove a User’s information from its systems. For example,
          LifeLoop may retain a User’s personal information for legitimate
          business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future
          abuse, for account recovery purposes, if required by law or as
          retained in LifeLoop’s data backup systems or cached or archived
          pages. All retained personally identifiable information will continue
          to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which the User has
          previously agreed.
