          </p>
          <p>
            We use cookies for content personalization, analytics/performance,
            functional purposes, as well as the ability to access secure areas
            of our site. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual

            <strong>4. What is a Cookie?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a
            web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read
            by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Some of
            the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select
            certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can
            find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list
            below. We update this list biannually, so there may be additional
            cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may
            be used in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies,
            count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and
            determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may
            receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our
            service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
