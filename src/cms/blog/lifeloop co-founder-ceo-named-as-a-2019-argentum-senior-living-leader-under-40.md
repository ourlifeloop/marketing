**Omaha, Nebraska** — LifeLoop, an Omaha-based creator of a life-enrichment platform for senior living communities, is pleased to announce that co-founder & CEO Amy Johnson has been selected as a 2019 Senior Living Leader under 40 by Argentum. Argentum is the leading national trade association serving companies that own, operate and support professionally managed senior living communities in the United States.  

This distinguished award recognizes emerging visionaries for leading and implementing programs to advance senior living initiatives; working to advance meaningful public policy on behalf of senior living providers and those they serve; taking opportunities to educate the public on the “heart” of senior living; and/or involved with science or academia that is advancing the gerontological field.

She followed her vision to build a company that allows families to be actively engaged with the daily lives of their loved ones living in senior communities.

“I am incredibly honored and humbled to receive this award and to be in such great company with the other award recipients,” said Johnson. “Building LifeLoop from the ground up along with my team has been a labor of love and something I truly believe in. Getting to see how our product positively effects the lives of so many people (residents, staff and families) is more than I could ever ask for.” 

In 2016, Johnson’s pitch garnered LifeLoop a $100,000 investment from AOL co-founder Steve Case at the Rise of the Rest startup pitch competition.
