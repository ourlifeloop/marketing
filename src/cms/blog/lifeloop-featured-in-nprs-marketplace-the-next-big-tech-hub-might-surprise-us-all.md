Amy Johnson, Co-founder of LifeLoop, explains in a recent interview with National Public Radio (NPR), “I think Omaha and in the Midwest in general, people are solving problems that they've experienced, not perceived, you know, and I think that's a big difference,” Johnson said. “I've spent hours in communities with these people, and really identified that pain.”
