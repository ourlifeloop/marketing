LifeLoop was implemented at Nye Square starting in
January 2016. From the reports, which are still
available today, it appears there was low tracking,
and/or a lack of activities offered.
Fast forward to May 2018, there was little knowledge
about the functionality of LifeLoop. We did our first
activity calendar in word, editing each font size as we
went. By about 6 months in, we had a decent handle
on LifeLoop, and the activity calendar was much
more robust and widespread. The numbers reflected
show Nye Squareâ€™s progress to my knowledge, based
on May 2018, December 2018 (halfway point), and June 2019.
