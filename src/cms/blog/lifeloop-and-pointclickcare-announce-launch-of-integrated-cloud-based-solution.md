Omaha, Nebraska — LifeLoop, Omaha-based creator of a life enrichment platform for senior living communities, and PointClickCare, the leading provider of cloud-based records systems for senior living management, have announced that they will combine their capabilities to offer an integrated solution.

With this new service, senior living staff can use PointClickCare’s electronic health record (EHR) system to access data related to activities and life enrichment.

“In senior living, working with multiple records systems can be a drain on staff efficiency,” said Nick Nemer, LifeLoop’s Vice President of Business Development. “Our integration with PointClickCare will help remove some of the friction, and free up more time for staff to interact directly with residents.”

These two companies, leaders in their respective fields, are taking this step to help break down the data silos in senior living. The new joint solution begins to bridge the divide between clinical work and life enrichment activities.

“We are tremendously excited that LifeLoop has joined our rapidly growing Developer Program community,” said Jeff Scheepers, Director of Global Partnerships at PointClickCare. “LifeLoop’s solution meets an immediate need in the long-term post-acute care market; connecting residents to loved ones in order to drive increased engagement, which ultimately improves care outcomes. This partnership, underpinned by PointClickCare’s industry-leading integration framework, enables our customer communities to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive marketplace.”

Housing activity information within PointClickCare’s EHR streamlines access for many senior living communities. They’ll be able to interact with activity and life enrichment data in a familiar format, which will speed the integration of this data into their workflows.
