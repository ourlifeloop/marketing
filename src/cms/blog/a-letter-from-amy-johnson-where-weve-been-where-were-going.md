### The Beginnings

LifeLoop has always been a passion project for us. When starting this company seven years ago, we didn’t know what to expect. All we knew was that this product, this idea, was one that people needed. We knew nothing about senior living and knew even less about starting a company of our own. We had one customer who believed in our idea, and that was enough for us. 

Through the process of building our product, we learned a lot, and frankly, we failed a lot. But we have always believed that you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes. My team and I learned this industry from the ground level. We went to communities and asked about their pain points. We shadowed staff members and interacted with residents and it was through those experiences that we imagined what LifeLoop could become. Over the past seven years, LifeLoop has evolved into something that I am truly so proud of. Our product, and more importantly the team behind the product, has made an impact in senior living communities all across the country and even the world. 

### A New Chapter

Our vision for LifeLoop has never changed. We have always set out to help caregivers create communities that people love being a part of. And we are so fortunate that together with iN2L, we can extend our mission and continue to positively impact the lives of older adults. Our partnership, and the extensive product offering that we have together, has been a long time coming. Their passion for the senior living industry matches our own and our teams are truly aligned and excited to move forward as one. I am exceedingly grateful for the opportunities that are coming from this partnership. And I can’t wait to be a part of the positive change this will have in senior living. 

### What does this mean for you?

The ability to deliver—from a single platform—services and engagement that enhance the well-being, experience, and satisfaction of your residents and their families is a game-changer for our industry. I believe this whole-heartedly. Our continued goal is to remove administrative burdens and streamline operations giving team members more time in the day to foster connections with residents.

As we bring the LifeLoop and iN2L teams and products together, please know that it’s business as usual on a day-to-day basis, and you can count on the same exceptional support and service that you’re accustomed to from our team. We’re here to support you, and if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact myself or anyone on our Customer Success team. 

*All my best,*
