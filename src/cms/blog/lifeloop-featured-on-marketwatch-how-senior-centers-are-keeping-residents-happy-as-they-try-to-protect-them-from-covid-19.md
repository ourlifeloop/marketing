Avamere Senior Living's Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Thomas Cloutier, was interviewed by MarketWatch.com along with Amy Johnson, LifeLoop CEO. 

An excerpt from the article is below:

Technology has become crucial for most centers to stay in touch with loved ones, not just for video chatting but communication about care between nursing home staff and families.

“Transparency is huge right now,” said Amy Johnson, chief executive officer of Lifeloop, a technology company that specializes in communication between senior living centers and loved ones. The company has seen an influx of sign ups for the platform during the coronavirus crisis, she said. The platform, which also has an app, allows staff to gather data, such as when meals are served and transportation is scheduled, as well as send pictures and stay engaged. Avamere currently uses Lifeloop, which has made it easier to keep loved ones connected during facility lockdowns, Cloutier said.
