Nearly 16 million Americans 65 and older are living alone; on a day like Valentine’s Day, where everyone is celebrating love, it's easy to feel lonely.

Dozens of volunteers from LifeLoop gathered to share a little love Friday with 500 seniors in Omaha. They’re working as a part of the national movement #CupidsCrew.

“Valentine’s Day can be a day for a lot of adults and a lot of seniors that can be very lonely,” said Andrea Clauson of LifeLoop. “Aging is a beautiful thing but in reality, it can feel very lonely and isolating at times.”

A single rose, and a little time, means the world to them.

“Maybe this wasn't supposed to make me cry so much,” a Brookstone Meadows senior said.

“You are such a sweetheart,” Clauson replied. “Valentine’s Day is a day of love so it can be emotional sometimes.”

\#CupidsCrew is happening in 500 cities across the United States. Their goal is to deliver 50,000 roses to seniors.
