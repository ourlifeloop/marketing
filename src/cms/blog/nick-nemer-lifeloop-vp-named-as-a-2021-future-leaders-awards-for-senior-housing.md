## Aging Media Announces the Future Leaders Awards Class of 2021

The Future Leaders Awards program presented by Aging Media Network recognizes leadership excellence at a variety of levels in care delivery and aging.

CHICAGO (PRWEB) AUGUST 16, 2021

Aging Media Network, Inc. (“Aging Media”) is excited to announce the winners of the 2021 Future Leaders Awards from the senior housing, skilled nursing, home health and hospice industries. This selection of high-performing individuals represents unwavering strength and leadership through some of the most adverse conditions the aging industry has ever seen.

Aging Media recognizes dynamic leaders, ages 40 and under, who are laying the foundation for a bright future in care delivery and aging. They are focused both on improving health outcomes and driving organizational goals with a profound commitment to the wellbeing of the aging population and the industries they serve.

“This group of professionals represents the critical skills of tomorrow’s health care leaders,” said Aging Media Co-Founder George Yedinak. “Each of these leaders has the professional experience to help their organizations deliver better experiences and outcomes.”

With a record number of nominations, this year’s Future Leaders class recognizes 40 individuals across the continuum, all of whom will be featured in upcoming Aging Media publications and invited to Aging Media’s FUTURE Conference in Chicago, IL on September 30, 2021.

The 2021 awards program is sponsored exclusively by PointClickCare Technologies, the leading cloud-based software platform for the senior care market today.

"I’m thrilled to offer my congratulations to the 2021 award recipients," said Dave Wessinger, founder and president of PointClickCare Technologies, the leader in cloud-based healthcare software for the long-term, acute and post-acute care market and two-time sponsor of the Future Leaders Awards program. “I am honored to be a part of recognizing these individuals on behalf of PointClickCare, for their incredible achievements and on-going contributions to advancing care for aging populations.
