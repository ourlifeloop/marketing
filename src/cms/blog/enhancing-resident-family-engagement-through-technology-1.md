Prior to July 2017, the Life Enrichment teams and Management teams at all Cascadia communities were tracking their resident engagement for both group and individual activities on paper. Due to this process, the information was difficult to analyze, and it was a very manual process to find ways to inform/involve families on the day-to-day lives of their loved ones. In July 2017 LifeLoop was implemented. This case  tudy will look at how LifeLoop has enhanced the resident and family engagement.
