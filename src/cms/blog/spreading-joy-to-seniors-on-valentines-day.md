Love comes in all different shapes, sizes and ages. The company LifeLoop brought kids to Aksarben Village Senior Living Center to help celebrate Valentine's Day with the residents who live there.

Flowers can brighten up anyone's day. For LuAnn Stewart, a rose on Valentine's Day made her feel special.

"To be a part of something that is giving, that just makes me very happy," Stewart said.

School-age children passed out the valentines to senior citizens across the metro.

"It can be a really lonely day for a lot of seniors because spouses have passed. If we can do one little thing to make their day a little better, then that's what its all about," Life Loop CEO Amy Johnson said.

Johnson said bringing seniors and children together is important.

"It's good for kids to just kind of look through another perspective," Johnson said.

"It's an experience for us, too, not just them. So it is a two-way street," Stewart said.

Stewart has been married for 63 years. She said the key to a long-lasting love is to let the disagreements go.



"Always, if we got mad at one another, we'd say, 'Hey, it'll be better in the morning,'" Stewart said.



The children visited seven senior citizen centers Friday.
