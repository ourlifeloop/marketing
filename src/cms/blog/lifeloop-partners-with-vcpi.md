Vcpi, a nationwide provider of outsourced IT services and LifeLoop, a cloud-based application that enhances resident, family and provider connections in senior living communities, have entered into a strategic partnership to enable vcpi’s clients to easily leverage LifeLoop’s application in their communities.  

 “When we started LifeLoop in 2015 we did so with one mission, to improve the care and overall experience of residents living in senior living communities. Partnering with vcpi is an opportunity to leverage a trusted IT services provider for the senior living industry to help us accomplish this.” – Amy Johnson, CEO, LifeLoop

In 2014, Amy’s close family member was a resident in a progressive care senior living community. While she had started out on the independent living side, she quickly progressed to assisted living, then memory care. Her family couldn’t help but wonder what warning signs they may have missed. This personal situation sparked them to consider “How can we improve the ability for families to be involved in their loved ones care?” 

The resulting product, designed in conjunction with senior living community owners and operators, was LifeLoop.  LifeLoop connects families, actively engages residents and helps streamline caregiving operations. Being in the loop means always having the latest information at your fingertips. Features including messaging, photo sharing, calendars, and activity logging allow families to communicate with and track the status of their loved ones at anytime and from anywhere. These same features allow residents to engage with their family members, friends and caregivers as well as the ability to sign up for activities and request transportation or maintenance.    

Not only does LifeLoop help families stay engaged in caregiving, it also reduces the amount of time caregivers spend charting and analyzing resident behavior and activities. With staff turnover a constant challenge in senior living, the information provided in LifeLoop can be used to get new staff members “in the loop” quickly, enabling greater consistency in the resident’s experience.

“LifeLoop has developed a user-friendly technology, born of their own personal experience, that connects residents, families and providers in a way that can positively impact the senior living experience for all. We are excited and grateful to be partnering with LifeLoop to further our shared mission.” – Zachary Koch, VP of Client Services, vcpi
