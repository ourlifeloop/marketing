question: Can residents sign up for activities within LifeLoop?
answer: Yes. Residents can login to LifeLoop to view the activity calendar and
  sign up for the activities that they would like to attend. These will then
  transfer to their 'my calendar' for them to view all the activities they are
  registered for each day all in one place. They will also receive a reminder
  1-2 hours prior to the activity that they have it coming up.
