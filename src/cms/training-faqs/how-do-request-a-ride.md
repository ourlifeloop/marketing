question: How do I request a ride?
answer: >
  Select the "Transportation" tile. On the top right-hand corner, click  "+ New
  Request". Fill out the form to the best of your ability and then select
  "Create New Request".

  Note: Your request will show in the transportation tile as "pending" until your community approves or denies the request. All requests will remain in the list, including denied and cancelled requests. The status will show on the right hand side reading "Cancelled'" or "Denied" to note that that trip will not be happening or "Approved" if it will be.
