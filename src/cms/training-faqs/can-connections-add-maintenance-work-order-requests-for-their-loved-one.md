question: Can Connections add Maintenance work order requests for their loved one?
answer: This depends on the Community.  If "Maintenance" is listed as a feature
  in your toolbar for your Community, Connections may be able to submit requests
  if your team has requested this function be turned on for Connections. Once
  submitted the request will show in "work orders" with a yellow flag next to
  it, signifying it was submitted by a Connection.
