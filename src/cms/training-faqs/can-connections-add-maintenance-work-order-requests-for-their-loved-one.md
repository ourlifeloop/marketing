question: Can connections add work requests for their loved one?
answer: This depends on the community.  If "Work Requests" is listed as a
  feature in your toolbar for your community, connections may be able to submit
  requests if your team has requested this function be turned on for
  connections. Once submitted the request will show in "Work Orders" with a
  yellow flag next to it, signifying it was submitted by a connection.
