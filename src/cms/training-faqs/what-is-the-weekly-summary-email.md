question: What is the weekly summary email?
answer: The weekly summary email is an email that goes out to connections weekly
  on Saturday afternoons. The email will contain a count of all activities your
  loved one has attended the past week (if the family activity feed is turned on
  for your community), as well as updates from the community and ways to
  interact with LifeLoop. We often run campaigns in this email such as the
  ability to send your loved one a post card or a shout out to a community staff
  member!
