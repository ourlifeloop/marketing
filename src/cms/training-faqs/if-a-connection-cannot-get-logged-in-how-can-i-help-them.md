question: If a connection cannot get logged in how can I help them?
answer: The link from their invite email is for one-time use. You can remind
  them to log in through the mobile app or at http://lifeloopapp.com/login using
  our preferred browser Google Chrome.  Username will be full email address with
  the password they created.  If still having problems, direct them to LifeLoop
