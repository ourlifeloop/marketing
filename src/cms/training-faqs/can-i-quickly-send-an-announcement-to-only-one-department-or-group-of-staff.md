question: Can I quickly send an announcement to only one department or group of staff?
answer: "-Yes! You can create any groups from your Staff List two ways. First by
  clicking the \"+ Group\" button next to their name, typing a new group name
  into the bar showing 'Choose group tags' and hitting enter key or use the
  drop-down to select an already existing group and pressing 'Submit\".  Second,
  from the Staff List you can check the box to the left any/all staff names you
  would like in a group then use the  dropdown from the 'Selected' button that
  appears on the top right and select 'Add to Group'.  Once a group is created,
  you can easily select this 'Group' to send Announcements to! "
