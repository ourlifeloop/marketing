question: ' How do I add an "about" section for a resident? '
answer: 'Click on the "Residents" tab. Locate the resident that you wish to add
  information to and select the "Edit" quick action icon. This will take you to
  their profile, select "About" on the left below profile and add an
  anniversary, their likes and dislikes (which are searchable in the resident
  search bar), input their biography and mark if they are a veteran (which will
  show a medal icon next to their name in LifeLoop) and if they have declined a
  photo release (which will show a red camera with a line through it next to
  their name in LifeLoop). '
