question: ' How do I add an "about" section for a resident? '
answer: >-
  -On the left-hand side, within the blue panel, click on the “residents”
  button. 


  -Locate the resident that you wish to add information to and select the “edit”
  quick action icon. 


  -This will take you to their profile, select about on the left below profile
  and add an anniversary, their likes and dislikes (which are searchable in the
  resident search bar), input their biography and mark if they are a veteran
  (which will show a medal icon next to their name in LifeLoop) and if they have
  declined a photo release (which will show a red camera with a line through it
  next to their name in LifeLoop).
