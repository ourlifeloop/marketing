question: "Can I put a work request in for my resident? "
answer: This depends on your community's functionality. If you can, you will see
  a "Work Requests" tab in the feature menu. Select this then click on "+ New
  Request" at the top right-hand side of your screen. Fill out the form then
  click the "Create Request" at the bottom. Once you have submitted a request
  you can check the status in the "Work Requests" tab.
