question: "Can I put a work request in for my resident? "
answer: This depends on your community's functionality. If you can, you will see
  a "Work Requests" tab in the blue panel on the left-hand side of your screen.
  Select this and find the "New Request" button on the top right. Fill out the
  form and be sure to click the green "Submit" button at the bottom. Once you
  have submitted a request you can check the status in the "Work Requests" tab.
