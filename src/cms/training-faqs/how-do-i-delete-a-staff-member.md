question: "How do I delete a staff member? "
answer: 'Click on the "Staff" tab. Find and select the staff member you’re
  wanting to edit and click on that staff member’s name. The staff member’s
  information will appear. On the top right hand of the screen click the "Edit"
  button.  A new screen will appear as though you’re adding a new resident and
  you will want to go through that staff member’s information and make the
  appropriate changes to their account. Once you’ve made all the changes you’d
  like, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on the  "Update Staff"
  button. '
