answer: Click on the "Staff" tab. Find and select the staff member you’re

  information will appear. Select the "Account" from the light blue menu on the
  left-hand side. Click on the "Delete Staff" button on the bottom right-hand
  side of the screen. This will remove the staff member from LifeLoop staff list
  as well as remove their ability to log in to LifeLoop.
