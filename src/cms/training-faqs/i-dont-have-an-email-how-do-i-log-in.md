question: If a staff member doesn't have an email, how do they log in?
answer: LifeLoop offers the option to send staff welcome invitations to join
  LifeLoop via SMS test message as long as the staff member has a valid phone
  number provided in their staff profile. An alternative option would be for the
  LifeLoop Champion at the community to provide the staff member with their
  assigned username and create a password. Once the staff member has logged in,
  they can change their password.
