question: 'Can Connections submit a Transportation request for their loved one? '
answer: '-This depends on the Community.  If  "Transportation" is listed as a
  feature in your toolbar for your community, Connections may be able to submit
  requests if your team has requested this function be turned on for
  Connections. A staff member will still need to approve the request. Once
  approved the transport will show on the residents ''My Calendar''. '
