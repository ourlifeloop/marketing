question: How do I register myself for an activity?
answer: >
  Select the Calendar tile. Scroll through the days by using the blue arrows on
  the top right. When you find the activity that you would like to register for
  click the '+ Register' button. You are now registered! Note: If the maximum
  number of residents has registered for the activity then you will instead be
  added to the waitlist.
