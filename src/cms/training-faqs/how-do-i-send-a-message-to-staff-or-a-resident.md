question: How do I send a message to staff or a resident?
answer: >-
  Select the 'Communication' tab on the left-hand side. Next, click the blue
  "New message button" to create a new message thread. Chose your recipients by
  clicking the blue arrows next to each name 

  (note: not all residents log into LifeLoop so if you want to ensure that your message is seen, include a staff member) If all recipients have been selected click "start message thread" Now at the bottom of your screen you can type your message in the text box and send by clicking the green "send" button.
