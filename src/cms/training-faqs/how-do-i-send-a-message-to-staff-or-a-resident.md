question: How do I send a message to staff or a resident?
answer: >-
  Select the "Communication" tab in the feature menu.  Click on "New Message" to
  create a new message thread. Chose your recipients by clicking the blue arrows
  next to each name 

  (note: not all residents log into LifeLoop so if you want to ensure that your message is seen, include a staff member). If all recipients have been selected then click on "Start Message Thread" at the bottom of your screen. Type your message in the text box and send by clicking the"Send" button.
