question: How do I send a Message to Staff or a Resident?
answer: >-
  To begin, login to your LifeLoop account. 


  Either on the right-hand side or under the Message tab choose Create Message. 


  Here is where you can choose who you are sending to (staff, resident and other
  connected family) and enter your message. 


  Once done, click on the Send Message on the bottom right.â€¯ 


  NOTE: If your resident is not an active user include a staff member on your
  message so they can make sure to share it with them. All previous message
  threads you have will also be under the Message tab.
