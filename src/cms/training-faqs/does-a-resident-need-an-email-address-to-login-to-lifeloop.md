question: Does a resident need an email address to login to LifeLoop?
answer: No. LifeLoop creates a pre-set username for all residents in LifeLoop so
  that they can log in regardless of if they have an email or not. All you have
  to do is set a password for them and provide them with the username & password
  combo. We suggest downloading the Resident Sign Up Card to provide them a hard
  copy of their login information.
