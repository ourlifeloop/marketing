question: 'How do I take attendance at an activity? '
answer: >-
  -From a web browser you have two areas you can take attendance from, the
  Dashboard or the Calendar. 


  -On the dashboard simply hover over the activity in the Agenda and click “take
  attendance”. 


  -To track from the calendar first go to the left-hand side within the blue
  panel, click on the “Calendar” button. 


  -The Calendar will default to the last view you were in, Day, Week or Month.
  Activities can be tracked from the Day or Month View. 


  -In the month view, locate the activity in which you would like to capture
  attendance for in the agenda on the right-hand side, hover your mouse over and
  click “take attendance”.  If the activity is not from today, simply click on
  the day on the calendar you would like to pull up. 


  -In the day view, locate the activity in which you would like to capture
  attendance for and select “take attendance”. If you have a smaller screen it
  may not say take attendance and have just an icon of a person’s profile with a
  check mark instead. 


  -All the Residents at that community will appear in the take attendance modal
  and can be marked with a green check for attended and a yellow dash for
  declined.  


  -For more detail select a declined reason. Also, some communities have the
  star engagement rating turned on and can select the resident engagement while
  taking attendance. 


  -To avoid scrolling through all residents simply type in the residents name or
  unit number in the search feature. 


  -Attendance is automatically saved and you can exit out or click on a
  different feature to start your next action.
