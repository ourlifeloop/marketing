question: How do I capture if a resident has declined to attend an activity and
  in what situations should I track declines?
answer: "Declines can be tracked when taking attendance – to learn how to take
  attendance refer to 'How do I take attendance at an activity?'. Whether you
  track declines is a community choice. LifeLoop’s best practice is to choose
  decline if you have asked them to come and they decline or if they are
  normally a regular at a specific activity and it is abnormal that they did not
  attend. "
