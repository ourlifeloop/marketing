question: I am not able to add a connection and receive an error.
answer: "Sometimes a connection may already have a profile in LifeLoop. If their
  loved one moved from a different community this could be the case and you will
  want to reach out to LifeLoop Support. The other common error is a
  connection's email is inputted into the resident's account info on accident. "
