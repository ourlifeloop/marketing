question: How do I view attendance reports?
answer: >-
  -On the left-hand side within the blue panel, click on the “Reports” button. 


  -If you do not see Reports, you do not have permission or access. 


  -In the reports tab you are able to customize a time frame and grouping for a
  report you would like to generate. You can search attendance for all
  activities, attendance by resident and for the facility as a whole by changing
  the grouping. 


  -This information can then be printed or exported in an excel file. 


  -There are also a variety of reporting charts if you select charts on the top
