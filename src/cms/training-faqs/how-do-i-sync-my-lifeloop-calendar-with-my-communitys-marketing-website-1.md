question: How do I sync my LifeLoop calendar with my community's marketing website?
answer: >-2
   On the left-hand side, click on the 'Calendar' tab. Select the Community's calendar from the drop-down menu on the top left that you wish to embed into your website. Updates made in LifeLoop will auto update on your website. Select the 'Print/Export' button on the top right and choose 'Embed Month Code' for Web. 

  NOTE: LifeLoop provides the code that needs to be embedded into your community's website code. This is something that may need to be done by your IT department or Website Manager.
