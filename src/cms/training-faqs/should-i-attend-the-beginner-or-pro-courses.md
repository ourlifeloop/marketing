question: Should I attend the Beginner or Pro courses?
answer: Eventually both! Think of the Beginner courses as Freshman year, you
  want to get all your base knowledge first. Once you have completed these
  courses and are ready to move on to the more advanced options it's time to
  attend the Pro Courses. If you have been using LifeLoop for awhile feel free
  to skip beginner and go into pro!
