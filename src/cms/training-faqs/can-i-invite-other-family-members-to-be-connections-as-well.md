question: Can I invite other family members to be connections as well?
answer: -You will not be able to invite other family members to be
  connections.  In order to get other family members to be connected to a
  resident, you will need to reach out to the community or your loved one
  directly to have them add your family member as a connection. This is due to
  the privacy of the resident. LifeLoop is unable to add additional connections
  for this reason, so please reach out to the community or resident directly.
