question: My loved one won't be using LifeLoop, what is the benefit for me?
answer: >-
  -LifeLoop understands that older adults may have a hard time using technology
  and may choose not to use the system themselves. But it can still be
  beneficial to you! Staff at the community can tag your loved one in photos,
  register them for activities and even send you personal messages. 


  -You can continue to follow along to see what your loved one is doing day to day. 


  -You can send a message to the staff if you would like to see how your loved on is doing and they can also reach out to you if they need to get in contact with you. 


  -Staff love sharing photos with residents and as a connection you can add photos to LifeLoop for staff to share with your loved one. 


  -You can also request maintenance and transportation for your loved one if they cannot do it themselves.
