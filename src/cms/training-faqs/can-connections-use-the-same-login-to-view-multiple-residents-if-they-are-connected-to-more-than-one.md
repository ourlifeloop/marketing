question: Can Connections use the same login to view multiple residents if they
  are connected to more than one?
answer: Yes. If Connections are connected to multiple residents they will be
  able to filter and select which resident they want to view. However, they can
  not be connected to multiple residents at different companies at this time
  with the same email address.
