question: How do I invite family and friends of a resident?
answer: >-
  On the left-hand side, click on the 'Residents' button. Find the resident you
  would like to add a connection to. While remaining in the resident list,
  select the third 'quick action' icon. Type the connections email in the box
  that appears. The family will receive an email and complete registration. You
  can also invite loved ones by going to the "Connections" tab in the blue panel
  on the left-hand side of your screen and choosing the "invite" button on the
  top right-hand side. 

  This will then prompt you for the resident the connection is tied to and their email address.  


  NOTE: It is very important to double-check that emails are entered correctly when inviting family to ensure that the right person is receiving this invitation.
