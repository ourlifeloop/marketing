question: If I forget my password how do I retrieve it?
answer: On the log-in page (lifeloopapp.com/login) you can select "Forgot Your
  Password?". This will direct you to another page where you can enter the email
  address that is associated with your LifeLoop account. We will email you a
  password reset link where you can then change your password.
