question: My add activity button is gone.
answer: 'If your "Add Activity" tab is gone, refresh your browser (Usually a
  circle with an arrow to the left of your URL box).  If this does not work, go
  into your browser settings, normally to the right of your URL, three lines or
  dots and go to history or cache and clear history. '
