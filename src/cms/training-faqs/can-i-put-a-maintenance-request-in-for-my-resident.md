question: 'Can I put a Maintenance request in for my resident? '
answer: >-
  This depends on your community's functionality:


  If you can you will see a "Maintenance" option in the blue panel on the left-hand side of your screen. 


  Select this and find the “New Request” button on the top right. 


  Fill out the form and be sure to click the green “Submit” button at the bottom 


  Once you have submitted a request you can check the status in the Maintenance tab.
