question: Why am I not able to add a connection and receive an error?
answer: The connections email may already be in use in LifeLoop. If their loved
  one moved from a different community, you may be getting this error and you
  will want to reach out to LifeLoop Support. The other common error is a
  connection's email is inputted into the resident's account as the residents
  email address. The same email address cannot be used twice in LifeLoop. The
  connection may need to use a different email address, delete an old account or
  remove the email address from the residents account.
