question: What are recurring work requests and how do I set this?
answer: When you create a new request, you have the option of setting up
  recurring event. If you need to have the same request to be set for multiple
  times a week, each week, month, etc. you can set this using the recurring
  option.  You can also make a current request recurring. Select which request
  you would like to make recurring, click on view details, click the edit button
  on the far right-hand side of the request and set recurring how often you
  would like it to recur.
