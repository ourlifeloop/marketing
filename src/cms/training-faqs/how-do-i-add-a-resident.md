question: How do I add a resident?
answer: "Click on the 'Residents' tab.  On the top right of the screen, click on
  the blue  '+ New Resident' button. Fill in the profile and select 'create
  user' at the bottom. If you do not see 'create user' a required field is
  missing. After the user is created you will be directed to the 'About' section
  for additional information input. You also have the option of adding
  attachments and accessing the Account & Security for the resident. The Account
  & Security contains the residentâ€™s login information. "
