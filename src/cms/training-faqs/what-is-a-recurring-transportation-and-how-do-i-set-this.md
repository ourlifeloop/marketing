question: What is a recurring transportation and how do I set this?
answer: >-
  - When you create a new request, you have the option of setting up recurring
  event. If you need to have the same transportation to be set for multiple
  times a week, each week, month, etc. you can set this using the recurring
  option. 


  - You can also make a current request recurring. Select which request you would like to make recurring, click on the edit button on the far right hand side of the request and set recurring how often you would like it to recur.
