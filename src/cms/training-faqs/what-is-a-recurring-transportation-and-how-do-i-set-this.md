question: "What is a reoccurring Transportation request and how do I create that? "
answer: >-
  -When you create a new request, you will have the option of setting up a
  recurring request. If you need to have the same transportation request at the
  same time each week, month or days, you can set this as a recurring event.  

  -You can also make a current request recurring if the request is still in pending,  select the event you want to edit, click on the edit button in the  upper right-hand corner and set your event to the days you want this event to recur.
