question: Can I view and/or print requests for a specific driver or vehicle?
answer: >-
  -Yes,  you can filter requests by status, type, vehicle and driver.  Once you
  select your filter, click on Done at the bottom and this will filter only what
  you have selected in the calendar and on the day selected.  


  -If you want to print a specific filter that you have selected,  go back to the top in the right-hand corner next to the blue +New Button and click on Print/Export.
