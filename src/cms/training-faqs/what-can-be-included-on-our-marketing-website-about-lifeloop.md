question: What can be included on our marketing website about LifeLoop?
answer: LifeLoop has multiple embed options for marketing websites, including
  for the calendar and displays. By embedding these items it provides a
  live-link from LifeLoop to the marketing site providing any visitors the most
  accurate up-to-date information. We also recommend adding an information
  section on LifeLoop and option for family to fill a form out and get
  connected. To discuss these options further reach out to your community's
  customer relationship specialist.
