question: Can I deregister for an activity that I have previously registered for?
answer: >
  In the "Calendar" tile, find the activity that you would no longer like to
  attend. On the right-hand side, click on the tab that reads either
  "Registered”, "Time-slot" or  “# on Waitlist”. You will now see that it reads
  "+ Register" and you are no longer registered for the activity.
