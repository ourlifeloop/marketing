question: Can I deregister for an activity that I have previously registered for?
answer: >
  In the "Calendar" tile, find the activity that you would no longer like to
  attend. Click on the button within the activity that reads either "Registered”
  or “# on Waitlist”. You will now see that it reads "+ Register" and you are no
  longer registered for the activity.
