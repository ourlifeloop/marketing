question: Can I deregister for an activity that I have previously registered for?
answer: "-\tIn the calendar, tile find the activity that you would no longer like to attend.\n-\tClick on the button within the activity that reads either “Registered” or “# on Waitlist”.\n-\tYou will now see that it reads “+ Register” and you are no longer registered for the activity.\n"
