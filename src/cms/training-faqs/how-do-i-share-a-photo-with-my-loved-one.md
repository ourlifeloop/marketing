question: How do I share a photo with my loved one?
answer: To begin, login to your LifeLoop account. If you are connected with
  multiple residents, select which one you would like to add the photo for.
  Next, click the 'Photo Library' option on the left-hand side and select 'Add a
  Photo'.â€¯ This will allow you to take a photo or to upload an already existing
  photo. Once photos are added they will appear in the Resident's Gallery.
