question: My resident no longer resides at the community, how do I stop
  receiving emails from LifeLoop?
answer: If you wish to no longer receive emails for any reason, please contact a
  staff member at your facility. You can do this in LifeLoop by logging in going
  into the 'Communication' tab. Then selecting 'Create Message' and selecting
  the staff member you are trying to reach.  They will then remove you from the
  email list. If you no longer wish to access LifeLoop at all got to 'My
  Profile' under your name in LifeLoop. Scroll down to the bottom and 'delete
  account' this will remove you from LifeLoop and end all emails.
