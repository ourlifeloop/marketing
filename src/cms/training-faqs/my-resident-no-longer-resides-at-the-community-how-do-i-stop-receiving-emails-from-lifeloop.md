question: >-
  My Resident no Longer Resides at the Community, how do I Stop Receiving Emails
  from LifeLoop? 
answer: >-
  If you wish to no longer receive emails for any reason, please contact a staff
  member at your facility. 


  You can do this in LifeLoop by logging in and selecting Create Message and
  selecting the staff member you are trying to reach.  


  They will then remove you from the email list. 


  If you no longer wish to access LifeLoop at all got to “My Profile” under your
  name in LifeLoop. 


  Scroll down to the bottom and “delete account” this will remove you from
  LifeLoop and end all emails.
