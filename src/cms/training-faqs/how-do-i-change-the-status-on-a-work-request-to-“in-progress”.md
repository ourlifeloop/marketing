question: How do I change the status on a Work Request to “in progress”?
answer: Select the 'Work Requests' tab on the left-hand side. From your work
  orders on the left-hand side, select the blue arrow on the request that you
  would like to mark “in progress.” Doing this adds the request to your to-do
  list and automatically marks it as "in progress".
