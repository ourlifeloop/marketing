question: How do I change the status on a work request to “in progress”?
answer: On the feature menu, select "Work Requests". Click on "backlog" from the
  light blue menu, locate the work request then select the blue arrow on the
  request that you would like to mark "In Progress.” Doing this adds the request
  to your to-do list and automatically marks it as "In Progress".
