question: How do I change the status on a work request to “in progress”?
answer: Select the "Work Requests" tab in the feature menu. From your work
  orders on the left-hand side, select the blue arrow on the request that you
  would like to mark "In Progress.” Doing this adds the request to your to-do
  list and automatically marks it as "In Progress".
