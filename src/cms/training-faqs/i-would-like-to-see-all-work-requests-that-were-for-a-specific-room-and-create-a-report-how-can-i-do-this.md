question: I would like to see all Work Requests requests that were for a
  specific room and create a report, how can I do this?
answer: >-
  Click on the 'Reports' button. On the top reports bar, select Work Requests.
  -Select the time range you would like to see work requests for. Under 'Group
  By' option, Choose 'Location' and select the community that location is
  associated with. You can now view a report of each location in the selected
  community for how many work requests were opened, completed and cancelled with
  the location they were, including room numbers.         


  -For a more detailed option, visit the Work Requests tab. You can go to the Closed section, utilize your filters to show the room numbers and export that information into an excel file or PDF with a customized timeframe.
