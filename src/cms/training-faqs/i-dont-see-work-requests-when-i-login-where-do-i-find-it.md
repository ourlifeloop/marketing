question: I don't see Work Requests when I login, where do I find it?
answer: -Once logged in you can find the Work Requests tab on the left-hand side
  of the screen in the blue LifeLoop task bar. Select and your requests view
  will open. If you do not see it, your community may not have this feature
  available to connections.
