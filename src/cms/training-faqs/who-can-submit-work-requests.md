question: Who can submit work requests?
answer: Staff members that have the permission to Manage or Create Work Requests
  have the ability to submit requests. Family and residents have the ability to
  put in a work request as long as the toggle is turned on for your community.
  You can discuss this with your LifeLoop Customer Relationship Specialist or
  LifeLoop Support if you would prefer to have this option on or off for the
  family and residents.
