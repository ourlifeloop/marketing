question: When should I order my calendar/newsletter prints to ensure I have
  them in time?
answer: >-
  We recommend ordering your prints by the 20th of the month. Print Orders are
  processed during regular business hours, Monday through Friday. Upon
  processing, the orders may take 8-10 business days for printing, shipment, and
  delivery. Materials (paper type) used may vary due to availability.

  Please plan accordingly!
