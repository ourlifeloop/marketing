question: How do I put my display on my website?
answer: >-
  Select "Displays" on the feature menu. Select the display you would like to
  share on your website. Select "edit display" to edit the settings of this
  display. Selecting "Publish" under "Publish public URL" will provide a
  shareable link that can be distributed publicly. Save the changes and you will
  now see the public URL on the display details that you can copy and share on
  your marketing site. Youwill now also see "Embed code" on the top right hand
  corner. Select "embed code" and use this code to put the display on your
  website. 


  Selecting Not Published provides extra security for the display to only be found by using the Fire TV Stick Connect Code.
