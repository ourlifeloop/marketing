question: " How do I deactivate a resident and when should we deactivate a resident?"
answer: "Click on the \"Residents\" tab. Locate the resident you need to
  deactivate in the resident list. Select that resident then click on the \"Edit
  Resident\" button on the top right. On the bottom left, select
  \"Deactivate\".  Once youâ€™ve done this, a form will appear asking you for the
  reason and date of deactivation and select the deactivate button. Deactivated
  residents will then be in the resident list when you use the filter and select
  'deactivated'. Common reasons for deactivation are discharge, vacation,
  resident passed away, rehab etc. LifeLoop always recommends deactivating
  versus deleting so that none of that resident information is lost. LifeLoop
  will not ever delete deactivated residents. "
