question: ' How do I deactivate a resident and when should we deactivate a resident?'
answer: >-
  -On the left-hand side within the blue panel, click on the “residents”
  button. 


  -Locate the resident you need to deactivate in the resident list. 


  -Select that resident and click “deactivate resident” on the top right. 


  -Once you’ve done this, a new screen will appear asking you for the reason and
  date of deactivation and select the deactivate button. 


  -Deactivated residents will then be in the resident list when you use the
  filter and select “deactivated”. 


  -Common reasons for deactivation are discharge, vacation, resident passed
  away, rehab etc. 


  -LifeLoop always recommends deactivating versus deleting so that none of that
  resident information is lost. LifeLoop will not ever delete deactivated
  residents.
