question: Where do I set work request types, locations and crew member?
answer: As long as you have the permissions to do so, you will be able to set
  and edit any work requests types, locations and crew members. Go to manage
  settings, the gear icon on the top right between the ? and bell icons on the
  top right-hand corner. Select the "Bolded Community Name" on the left-hand
  side bar. Click on "Work Requests" on the top menu bar. Under each section,
  you can set what you would like to show for types of work requests, locations
  and crew by just typing it in the blank space and hitting the "Create" button.
