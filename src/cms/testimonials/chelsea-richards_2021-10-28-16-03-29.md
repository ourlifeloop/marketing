quote: I use LifeLoop every day and it has been an extremely valuable
  communication tool for us here at Daymark. Our staff uses LifeLoop as a way to
  document and communicate important information about residents with each other
  and across shifts. LifeLoop also helps us connect with family members through
  messaging and sharing pictures. Our family members report they love these
  features about LifeLoop because it helps them to stay involved in our
  residents' lives and help them to stay informed with what their loved ones are
  doing here!
