quote: LifeLoop has been a remarkable tool for the residents of First
  Place-Phoenix and their families. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use platform that has helped
  the transition to moving to a supportive, inclusive apartment living. LifeLoop
  has brought together our community and has helped residents feel independent
  with utilization of the calendar feature and maintenance requests, all while
  the families feeling connected with knowing how engaged their loved one is.
