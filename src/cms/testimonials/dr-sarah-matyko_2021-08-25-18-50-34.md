quote: '"When you are choosing a vendor to work with, it is really important to
  choose a partner with the same core values that you have. What we really like
  about LifeLoop is that they genuinely want to improve resident quality of life
  first and foremost. And for us, it is a no-brainer to partner with an
  organization like that. And we are glad we did because we are seeing the
  metrics and seeing the improvements and seeing the engagement even during
  COVID."'
