quote: LifeLoop helped us solve problems we didnâ€™t even know we had. It allowed
  us to realize the types of things family members wanted to know about their
  loved ones. Also, the ability to keep on top of the community as a whole with
  LifeLoop was quite amazing. We thought we were on top of it but with LifeLoop
  we realized there was so much more we could be doing.
