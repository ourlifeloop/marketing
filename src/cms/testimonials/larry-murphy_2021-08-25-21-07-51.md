quote: LifeLoop helps us see the status of our schedule during the day in “real
  time”. For example, if a resident calls in a prescription pickup or enters it
  on LifeLoop, the driver might be in the area where the pharmacy is while he is
  doing another trip. He then can see it when out and save us from having to do
  another trip later in the day to the same area. So essentially it can
  streamline our process and make things more efficient.
