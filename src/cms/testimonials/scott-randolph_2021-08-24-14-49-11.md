quote: I can tell you from personal experience that LifeLoop has been a game
  changer for me as a Maintenance Director in managing scheduled property
  preventative maintenance and resident needs in the form of work orders for our
  property. I worked at another company prior to working at Dial and I wish I
  would have had a tool like LifeLoop. Not only does LifeLoop streamline
  communication, but it also eliminates the use of paper work orders and keeps a
  history of closed out work orders that you can search for if you need to.
