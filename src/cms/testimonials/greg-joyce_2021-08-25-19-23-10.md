quote: I wanted to let you know how much of a life saver LifeLoop has been for
  us. Never in a million years did we anticipate a pandemic as we were working
  to implement LifeLoop, but it has such a tremendous resource in navigating
  communication with residents and families in these strange times.  I canâ€™t
  imagine going through these times without it.
