quote: “Thank you LifeLoop for becoming our lifeline to our Mom. Many miles
  separate us from my mom but being able to log in and see all she is doing and
  what is coming up for her to do has been such a relief. I know seeing the
  photos of her being active and having a good time makes us all feel like we
  made the right decision. And being able to send her a postcard once a week is
  something she looks forward to. LifeLoop is very much appreciated by our
  entire family.”
