quote: LifeLoop has helped our staff to keep track of who we extend invitations
  to for all our activities and increase participation. The LifeLoop employees
  have been extremely helpful as well and are very responsive to all our
  questions. They also are open minded in taking our suggestions on how to make
  LifeLoop the best program possible for communities and families. I am so
  thankful to have LifeLoop as a part of our activities program and would
  recommend it to all senior living communities.
