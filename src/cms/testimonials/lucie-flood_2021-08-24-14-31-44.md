quote: LifeLoop has enhanced and simplified staff communication for our
  community through its messaging feature. We are now able to easily message
  each other, family and residents in one platform. I am always at ease that I
  never miss a message because of the notification I receive in LifeLoop as well
  as to my email. Our residents have also enjoyed using the messaging feature to
  contact staff and appreciate being able to view the calendar activities in
  their resident portal.
