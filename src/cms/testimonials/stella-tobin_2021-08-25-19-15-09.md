quote: "LifeLoop has made a difference to, not only our community, but it has
  been a window for the relatives to see their loved ones, especially during
  lockdown. And it still continues to be so comforting for them to see their
  relatives active and smiling!  On a personal level, it has put everything in
  one place and made me much more efficient in a job that is the antithesis of a
  ‘desk job.’ "
