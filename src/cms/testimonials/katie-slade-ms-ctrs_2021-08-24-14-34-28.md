quote: LifeLoop has been a wonderful tool for our community. It has allowed us
  to better share activity information with families, insure each resident is
  offered the opportunity to participate, and grow our activity calendar. Before
  using LifeLoop many of our families didnâ€™t realize all of the programming
  opportunities we offer. Now, they can feel included on the activities their
  loved one participates in, view photos, and have access to another form of
  communication.
