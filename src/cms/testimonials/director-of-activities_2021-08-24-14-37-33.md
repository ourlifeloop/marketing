quote: LifeLoop has given our community a tool that has helped streamline our
  Life Enrichment program. Due to the easy-to-use features, the Life Enrichment
  team now has the data to help tell the story of each resident and their needs.
  In addition, the program has created efficiencies allowing us to spend more
  one-on-one time with residents â€” which is priceless.
