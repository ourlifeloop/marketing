quote: 'LifeLoop is an amazing community resource for First Place- Phoenix. The
  platform provides the residents an easy to access calendar of community
  events, ability to independently submit maintenance requests, and an
  opportunity to connect with other residents. LifeLoop also gives families
  great peace of mind with the connections feature, allowing them to see their
  loved one’s activity in the community and keeping them up to date on what is
  to come. First Place Staff can track both individual resident progress and
  monitor community trends to stay up to date on how to best support the
  community’s needs. LifeLoop has helped turn an apartment building into a
  community we can all feel connected in. '
