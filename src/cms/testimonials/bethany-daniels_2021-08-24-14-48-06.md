quote: The LifeLoop transportation feature has made it much easier for our
  drivers to have addresses available while on transport. Another feature that
  has benefited us, is the ease it has allowed in scheduling appointments. Itâ€™s
  nice to click on the transportation calendar and see if a driver or vehicle is
  available on a certain day. It is also nice to see the transportations to be
  able to know where residents are going at a glance. One of the best features,
  I think, is how easy it is to operate LifeLoop. It was easy for me to access
  the transportation and navigate getting residents added with appointments.
  Everyone has enjoyed the new transportation feature.
