quote: We didn’t have a clue of the full picture of what LifeLoop was going to
  be able to do for us. The difference it was going to make in our operations,
  the difference it was going to make in our culture, the difference it was
  going to make for our families. Continuing to build that trust with the
  families in a way that has exceeded what we thought it was going to do. So,
  it’s been pretty great.
