quote: "I love all that LifeLoop has to offer! Two features have quickly become
  my favorites: the calendar designer and attendance tracking. As any Activities
  Director knows, planning and creating your calendars can take hours or even
  days. LifeLoop has simplified and expedited this process. Everyone I have
  encountered at LifeLoop has been so professional, helpful and patient. I am
  very happy I decided to give LifeLoop a try and would recommend LifeLoop to
  any activities professional without hesitation."
