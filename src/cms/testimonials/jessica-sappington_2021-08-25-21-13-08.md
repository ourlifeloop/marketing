quote: Residents and families are loving the LifeLoop app because they can share
  messages and pictures with each other easily. The residents especially love
  the directory and being able to sign up for activities right from their phone.
  We no longer print sign-up sheets, as the front desk staff or even residents
  themselves can register for an activity on LifeLoop. Family members also love
  that they can get pictures and reports about what their loved one is doing.
