## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install Gatsby.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```sh
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Install Dependencies.**

    Within project directory, install dependencies and start developing.

    ```sh
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
